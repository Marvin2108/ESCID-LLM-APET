# ESCID-LLM-APET

This repository contains the experimental code for **ESCID-LLM-APET**, a project on applying Prompt Engineering techniques to sentiment-related NLP tasks with Large Language Models.

The project covers three tasks:
- Sentiment Classification (SC)
- Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
- Irony Detection (MAST)

The LLM configuration is defined in `01_LLMs_konfigurieren.ipynb`.  
Each task contains multiple notebooks, one per Prompt Engineering approach.

The corresponding paper is available on arXiv:
